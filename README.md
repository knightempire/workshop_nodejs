# Node.js Workshop 🚀

Welcome to our Node.js workshop! In this session, we'll cover essential topics to get you started with Node.js and database integration.

## Agenda 📋

1. **Setting Up a Node.js Server** 🌐
   - We'll begin by covering the essentials of setting up a Node.js server.

2. **Connecting Node.js to a Database** 🗄️
   - Explore how to connect Node.js to a MySQL database and learn to manage data efficiently.

3. **Hands-On Project** 🔧
   - Apply everything you've learned by building a practical project.

## Project Overview 💡

In this project, we will implement a user authentication system using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Our goal is to create a registration and login form, as well as user and admin dashboards.

### Key Features 🌟

1. **User Registration** 📝
   - Users can register through a registration form.
   - Data will be stored in a MySQL database.

2. **User Login** 🔑
   - Users can log in with their credentials.
   - The system will verify their credentials and redirect them based on their user level.

3. **Dashboards** 📊
   - Users will have access to a user dashboard after logging in.
   - Admins will have access to an admin dashboard with additional features.

## Code Explanation 🛠️

### Registration Form
- The registration form collects user details (e.g., username, password, email).
- When submitted, the data is sent to the server, where it is validated and stored in the MySQL database.

### Login Form
- The login form collects username and password.
- Upon submission, the credentials are verified against the database.
- If valid, the user is redirected to either the user dashboard or admin dashboard based on their role.

### User and Admin Dashboards
- The user dashboard displays user-specific information.
- The admin dashboard includes functionalities such as managing users and viewing system statistics.

### Database Interaction
- We use a MySQL connection to handle data operations, such as inserting new users and verifying login credentials.
